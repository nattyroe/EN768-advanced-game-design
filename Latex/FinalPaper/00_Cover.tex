\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper will provide a high-level overview of Video Game
Design and it overlaps with Game Theory and Decision Theory.
It then analyzes combining features from Roguelike and Party
Games to create a new game loop structure to create a new
game, \textit{All Hands On Deck}, following the game from
initial conceptualization and design through an intial
prototype with play testing.
